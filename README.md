dotfiles for my computer macstar.  Features a working flake implementation and flake.nix written for nix-darwin.  
    -Python and python modules are included 
    -Homebrew installed managing GUI apps
    -nerdfonts
    -mas for managing apple store apps
    -.gitignore included for managing content
    - ~/flake.nix is hard linked to /etc/nix-darwin/flake.nix
In short if you have a working nix-darwin setup these files will make your mac look like mine.  Good Luck.
